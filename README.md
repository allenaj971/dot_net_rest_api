# dot_net_rest_api

This REST api was built using the .NET Core framework in C#.

It is an REST api that connects to a MSSQL database and stores a list of stock and their respective comments. It supports CRUD operations on the stocks and comments.

The reason I built this REST api is to learn the learn C# programming & the .NET Core framework and the development process to create a REST api.
